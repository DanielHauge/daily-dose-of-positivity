# Daily dose of positivity

To provide a daily dose of positivity to the world, and to those whom need or want it.
It is the decider of the day, the one who decides if you will have a good, amazing or excellent day!
Regardless of the weather, the day of the week, the month or the year, that person being in office, it will always be there for you.
